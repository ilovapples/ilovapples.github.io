        <p class="about_body">Search is a project that I (the developer of Search) am creating, purely because I felt like it. My (still the developer) username on every platform imaginable is ilovapples. You can barely count them: planetminecraft.com, w3schools.com, github.com, and others. If I remembered correctly, this project <i>should</i> be on Github, and you probably downloaded it from there, so... hi. The Github link is <a class="gitlink" href="https://www.github.com/ilovapples/HTML-Stuff/tree/main/search/">here</a>, incase you didn't download it from there before.</p>
